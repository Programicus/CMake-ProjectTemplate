# CMake-ProjectTemplate
Basic CMake template I use for all my projects

To use this, add as a remote into the repo, then use `git replace --graft <this repo's commit> <root repo commit>`. This will creat a graft commit that will merge the two. To update, just merge the new commits from this repo into master.
